1 ½ ounces* Midori  
1 ½ ounces Cointreau or Triple Sec  
1 ounce fresh lemon juice  
For the garnish: 1 small dry ice cube**, cocktail cherry  

can add 1/2 inch to 1 inch dry ice cube to make it bubble and boil.  


It’s often bright green, blue, or purple in color, and it can be served as a punch or shaken as a cocktail. This spin on the Witches Brew uses bright green melon liqueur and lemon juice to make a classic-style cocktail with a deliciously sweet tart flavor.
