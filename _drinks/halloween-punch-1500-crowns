64 ounces cranberry 100% juice blend (with grape, apple, and pear)*
64 ounces apple juice or apple cider
2 liters ginger ale (or 1 liter ginger ale and 1 750 ml bottle aged rum**)
2 4-inch to 5-inch chunks dry ice*** (optional)
Other garnish ideas: candy eyeballs, plastic spiders, gummy worms, etc.


Here’s a spooky drink that’s over-the-top fun: Halloween Punch! This blood red cauldron magically bubbles and boils, releasing tendrils of smoke all over the room. If that’s not impressive, we’re not sure what is! On its own it’s a fruity Halloween punch for kids, but turn it into a Halloween alcoholic punch by adding aged rum. It’s so much fun, we wish it was Halloween every month so we’d have another excuse to pull it out!
